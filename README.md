# Machine Learning Data Preprocessing and Training Application

This application provides a user-friendly command-line interface for loading, preprocessing, exploring, and training machine learning models on structured datasets. Users can input a dataset, handle missing values, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train models interactively.

# Data Cleaning, Visualization

This project provides a streamlined process for **Data Cleaning**, **Visualization**, and **Statistical Analysis** of a dataset, with a focus on improving data quality and extracting valuable insights through geographic and exploratory visualizations, as well as statistical summaries.

# Smart_Code_Evaluator
this tool would be quite useful for peer-reviewing code or as part of a learning platform where users receive instant feedback on their coding assignments.

# Blog_and_Image_Generator project
 The app uses `streamlit` to create a simple interface for generating a blog post, divided into an introduction, body, and conclusion. It also generates relevant images to go along with the text.

# Dashourd
The purpose of this code is to create a Streamlit web dashboard for visualizing various types of data related to user registrations, subscriptions, course completions, capstone evaluations, coupons, and user statistics. The app provides interactive visualizations and tables to explore data across different time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and user-related metrics.


# Pulsar Star Classification using SVM

This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to classify pulsar stars based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used for this classification is the `pulsar_data.csv`, containing 17898 instances and 9 features, including the target variable `target_class`.


# Abalone Age Prediction with Ridge Regression

This project focuses on predicting the age of abalone based on its physical attributes using a machine learning pipeline with **Ridge Regression**. The dataset includes various physical measurements of abalones, such as length, diameter, and weight, along with their corresponding age. The goal is to predict the abalone's age based on these features.

# House Price Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests
This project demonstrates the use of Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict house sale prices using the Ames housing dataset. The goal is to train a model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features such as lot area, year built, number of rooms, and more.


# House Rent Prediction 

This project focuses on predicting house rents using two machine learning models: **Linear Regression** and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. The dataset used is a CSV file containing various features related to house rentals.
