# Machine Learning Data Preprocessing and Training Application

This application provides a user-friendly command-line interface for loading, preprocessing, exploring, and training machine learning models on structured datasets. Users can input a dataset, handle missing values, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train models interactively.

# Data Cleaning, Visualization

This project provides a streamlined process for **Data Cleaning**, **Visualization**, and **Statistical Analysis** of a dataset, with a focus on improving data quality and extracting valuable insights through geographic and exploratory visualizations, as well as statistical summaries.

# Smart_Code_Evaluator
this tool would be quite useful for peer-reviewing code or as part of a learning platform where users receive instant feedback on their coding assignments.

# Blog_and_Image_Generator project
 The app uses `streamlit` to create a simple interface for generating a blog post, divided into an introduction, body, and conclusion. It also generates relevant images to go along with the text.
