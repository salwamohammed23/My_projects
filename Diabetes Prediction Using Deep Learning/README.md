# Diabetes Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of diabetes in patients using a deep learning model. The dataset used contains several medical attributes related to diabetes diagnosis, and the model is built using PyTorch.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the presence of diabetes

## Implementation
The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, and features and target labels are extracted.
2. **Model Definition**: A feedforward neural network model is defined using PyTorch.
3. **Training**: The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the test dataset.
4. **Visualization**: Loss and accuracy are plotted over epochs.

### Code Snippet
Here's a brief overview of the code structure:

```python
import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')

# Extract features and target variable
X = data.drop(['Outcome'], axis=1)
y = data['Outcome'].values

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, shuffle=False)

# Convert to Tensors
X_train = torch.FloatTensor(X_train)
y_train = torch.LongTensor(y_train)

# Define model
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(X.shape[1], 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 3)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(3, 2)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.sigmoid(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        out = self.sigmoid(out)
        out = self.fc3(out)
        return out
```

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset. The loss and accuracy are plotted to visualize the training process.

### Sample Output
- Epoch number: 1, Loss: 0.7218, Accuracy: 34.69%
- Epoch number: 601, Loss: 0.4514, Accuracy: 79.97%

## Visualizations
Loss and accuracy over epochs are plotted to show the model's performance.
