The code you've shared is for creating a **dashboard** using `Streamlit` to visualize and analyze user-related data such as registrations, subscriptions, course completions, coupon usage, evaluations, and user statistics. 

# Note: All the data in this dashboard has been extracted from an SQL database
# and converted into CSV files for analysis and display purposes.
### Explanation of the Code Components:

1. **Data Loading and Removing Duplicates**:
   - The `load_data` function is used to load data from a CSV file and remove duplicates.
   ```python
   def load_data(file_path):
       data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
       data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
       return data
   ```

2. **App Title**:
   - The app title is set using `st.title` with the text "Data Visualization Dashboard Developer".

3. **Tabs for Navigation**:
   - Multiple tabs are created (e.g., "1", "3", "4", etc.) to display different sections of data.
   ```python
   tab1, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab6, tab7, tab8, tab9, tab10 = st.tabs(["1", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"])
   ```

4. **Tab `tab1` - Subscription and Registration Analysis**:
   - This section allows users to select a time interval (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) to display registration and subscription data. Line charts using `Plotly` are generated to visualize the data.
   - Data is displayed as tables and line plots.

5. **Tab `tab3` - User and Course Completion Data**:
   - Displays a table with user data showing the number of completed courses, along with additional statistics like total users and total completed courses.

6. **Tab `tab4` - Current and Completed Course Analysis**:
   - Displays data related to currently learning courses and completed courses over a month or year.
   - A bar chart is used to represent the number of completed courses per user.

7. **Tab `tab5` - User Information**:
   - Allows users to search for a specific user by `user_id`. Once found, the app displays user information like subscriptions, completed courses, and capstone projects.
   
8. **Tab `tab6` - Capstone Evaluation**:
   - Displays information about capstone projects evaluated within selected time intervals (day, week, month, year).

9. **Tab `tab7` - Merging Data**:
   - Combines capstone project data with evaluation history and displays the merged dataset in a table.

10. **Tab `tab8` - Coupon Usage**:
    - Displays data about coupon usage by users, sorted by the number of users per coupon.

11. **Tab `tab9` - User Statistics**:
    - Provides statistics related to user demographics like age and study degree, showing the number of users in each category.

12. **Tab `tab10` - Employment Status**:
    - Displays data related to users' employment grant status (e.g., pending, accepted, postponed) and provides a count of users in each employment status category.

### Key Points:
- `Streamlit` is used to create an interactive user interface for visualizing data and charts.
- `Plotly` is used for creating interactive charts such as line charts and bar charts.
- `Pandas` is used for data manipulation and filtering.
- The app is organized into different tabs for easy navigation and analysis of various datasets.

You can run this `Streamlit` application by executing the following command:
```bash
streamlit run your_script.py
```
