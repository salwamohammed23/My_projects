            - **Inverse Relationship Between Lead Time and Price**:  
              As Lead Time increases, the Average Price tends to decrease. Early bookings (higher lead time) often secure lower prices, while last-minute bookings (low lead time) may be more expensive.
            
            - **High Density of Bookings at Lower Lead Times**:  
              The majority of bookings occur at a lead time of less than 100 days, indicating that most customers book within this period. A significant number of bookings also exist close to zero lead time, suggesting frequent last-minute reservations.
            
            - **Outliers in Price**:  
              There are a few points where prices are exceptionally high, particularly for low lead times (last-minute bookings). This could be due to premium rooms, peak season pricing, or high-demand periods.
            
            - **Few Bookings Beyond 300 Days**:  
              Very few bookings extend beyond 300-400 days, indicating that most people don‚Äôt plan trips that far in advance.

            - ** Difference in Booking Status (0 vs. 1)**:

               it appears that bookings with lower lead times may have a higher probability of cancellations.
