# Abalone Age Prediction with Ridge Regression

This project focuses on predicting the age of abalone based on its physical attributes using a machine learning pipeline with **Ridge Regression**. The dataset includes various physical measurements of abalones, such as length, diameter, and weight, along with their corresponding age. The goal is to predict the abalone's age based on these features.

## Project Overview

The pipeline built for this project includes the following key steps:

- **Data Wrangling**: Load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and preparing features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Use physical measurements (`Length`, `Diameter`, `Height`, `Weight`, etc.) and categorical features like `Sex` to predict the `Age` of the abalone.
- **Model Training**: Use Ridge Regression, a type of linear model with L2 regularization, to fit the model and avoid overfitting.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** on both the training and testing sets.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each abalone.
- `Sex`: Categorical feature with values `M` (Male), `F` (Female), and `I` (Infant).
- `Length`: Continuous feature representing the length of the abalone.
- `Diameter`: Continuous feature representing the diameter of the abalone.
- `Height`: Continuous feature representing the height of the abalone.
- `Weight`: Continuous feature representing the total weight of the abalone.
- `Shucked Weight`: Continuous feature representing the weight of the abalone's meat.
- `Viscera Weight`: Continuous feature representing the weight of the abalone's viscera.
- `Shell Weight`: Continuous feature representing the weight of the abalone's shell.
- `Age`: Target variable representing the age of the abalone.
