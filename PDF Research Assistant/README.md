# 📚 PDF Research Assistant

A research assistant application that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about their content. The system extracts text from the PDF, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings, stores them in a Chroma database, and uses Groq's language model to answer questions based on the document.

---

## 📝 Features

- Upload PDF files (supports scanned PDFs if OCR is applied externally).
- Ask questions related to the PDF content.
- Provides concise, context-based answers.
- Returns bullet points and references when appropriate.
- Supports **English** and **Arabic** interfaces.
- Uses semantic search for relevant document retrieval with `ChromaDB`.
- Powered by `SentenceTransformer` embeddings and `Groq` LLM for question answering.

---

## ⚡ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Gradio** – Web interface for interacting with the model.  
- **ChromaDB** – Embedding-based document store.  
- **SentenceTransformers** – For generating embeddings.  
- **Groq API** – Large language model for answering questions.  
- **pdfplumber** – Extracts text from PDF files.  
- **langchain_text_splitters** – Splits long text into manageable chunks.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pdf-research-assistant
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install gradio chromadb sentence-transformers pdfplumber langchain_text_splitters groq
```

3. Set your Groq API key in Google Colab:

```python
from google.colab import userdata
userdata.set('coder', 'YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY')
```

---

## 🖥️ Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

* Open the shared Gradio link or go to `http://localhost:7860`.
* Upload a PDF file.
* Ask a question about its content.
* Receive a clear answer generated by Groq based on the document context.

---

## 🌐 Supported Languages

* English
* Arabic

You can switch between versions using the tab interface in Gradio.

├─ app.py                  # Main application script
├─ README.md               # Project documentation
├─ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies (optional)
└─ rag_db/                 # ChromaDB persistent database directory
```

## ⚠️ Notes

* Works best with text-based PDFs. Scanned PDFs may require OCR preprocessing.
* Make sure your Groq API key is set correctly.
* Embeddings and document chunks are stored in a persistent ChromaDB folder (`rag_db`).
